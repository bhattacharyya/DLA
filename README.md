#        DLA
       Simulation of Diffusion Limited Aggregation
![0.2 stickiness](DLA_simulation.png?raw=true "DLA simulation example")

Run simulation with

```python run_simul.py ```

Remember to input kappa in scientific notation e.g. 5e-2

Visualize simulation with 

```python status_GUI.py```

Guess the stickiness factor kappa with

```python analyze.py```
